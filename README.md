# Memedora-Web
Memedora site inproved

# Why?
Well, im bored, so i decided to make this(for context, i took the website from [memedora.club](https://memedora.club))

# Its pure html, css and js
Well i know that, but i dont care.
Im planing to change it to express.js soon.

# How to use?
Install the live-server extension in your vscode, and hit "Go Live". (will be changed to express.js server soon)
